# FishingApp
App for tracking locations of fish using a simple UI on a mobile device, to support the RAF Angling team.

The app is to be a one-shot project, which if it is successful could then lead to a financially backed product.

The current solution is: https://codepen.io/jackisace/full/ExXLoRr.

Feel free to explore free alternative solutions, can you make something better/neater?
